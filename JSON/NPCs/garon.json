	"description": "A heavyset man who appears to be in his mid fifties. His hair is red and short but his red mutton chops are wild. He is wearing a faded, well worn green shirt with the sleeves rolled up under his slightly stained apron. As you approach him at the bar, he is polishing a mug with and old rag. 'Good day to you travelers, what can I do for you?'",
