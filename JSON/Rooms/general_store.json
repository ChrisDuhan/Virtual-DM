    "description": "A pleasant, musty aroma greets you as you stride through the door, likely a mixture of slightly aged materials that are stacked on low shelves and hanging from racks. There is plenty of light coming in from a section of the roof that has been propped open with a long pole. The bright light shows the age of the floorboards, with the shinyness of the age worn surfaces reflecting a mellowed light at you.",
